•This repository includes several projects where I’ve explored different datasets to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python.•

Each project focuses on understanding data, identifying patterns, and drawing useful insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).


*About the Projects

In these projects, I go through a complete data analysis process:

 > Loading and understanding the dataset

 > Cleaning missing or incorrect values
 
 > Exploring data through statistics and visualizations

 > Analyzing relationships between different variables

 > Summarizing key findings and insights

I’ve used real or sample datasets related to topics like hospital billing, sales, student performance, and weather trends.


*Tools and Libraries

These projects are built using Python and the following libraries:
 •Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis

 •NumPy – for numerical operations

 •Matplotlib – for creating basic visualizations

 •Seaborn – for advanced and styled visualizations


*Project Examples

Here are a few projects included in this repository:

 Hospital_Data_Analysis: Cleaning hospital data, analyzing patient demographics, and studying billing trends.

 Sales Data Analysis: Studying sales performance, customer behavior, and seasonal trends.

 IPL_Capstone_Project: Alanysis of IPL match 2022 with visualizations.

Each folder contains a dataset and a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis.


*How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-projects.git

1.Open the folder of the project you want to explore.

2.Run the Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook filename.ipynb



* What I Learned

  Through these projects, I practiced:
  
    1> Data cleaning and preprocessing
  
    2> Handling missing and inconsistent values
  
    3> Data visualization and storytelling
  
    4> Drawing insights from real-world data
